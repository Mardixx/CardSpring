# Card Collection
Remaking an old project from BeCode where you could add cards to a collection and delete them. \
I am remaking this project with Spring and H2 embedded V.2.

## How to deploy

To run this Back-End you will need to run the 'CardsSpringAngularApplication' Card and wait. This should allow you to go on the url `localhost:8080/card`. \
To make it work, you will need to have this repository running for anything to really happen [Front-End](https://github.com/Mardixx/AngularApp).

Note:
If nothing happens when you go to `localhost:8080/card` this could be because it hasn't started yet, in this case wait for a bit and retry.
